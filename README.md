### A custom-built OpeSim (JAM) API

Modifications:
1. COMAK without muscle volume weight
2. OpenSim API without ezc3d

Notes:
1. Both OpenSim and Ezc3d must have the same version; otherwise cannot be imported simultaneously.
    current Ezc3d version: 1.6.3
2. Ezc3d must be imported first; otherwise it doesn't function well.
